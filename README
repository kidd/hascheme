Hascheme

Hascheme is the name for Half assed scheme, or my attempt to do my version of
norvig's 90line scheme interpreter in python. But in Perl.

It doesn't support most of the things you'd expect for a usable language, like
strings, for example, but it's just a PoC of how easy can be to have an
interpreter for a language that lets you do quoting, recursion, lambdas, and
basic arithmetic ops.

debug tip :There's a builtin called env (no params) that dumps the environment.
